   The Worker is tested against a REAL SQLite database, not a mock of one.
   That is the whole point: the bugs worth catching here are SQL bugs — a
   column that is a keyword, an ON CONFLICT clause that does not fire, a
   UNIQUE index that lets a second row through — and none of them show up
   against a JavaScript object pretending to be a table.

   What is faked is only the SHAPE of the D1 client: prepare / bind / first /
   all / run / batch / exec. The statements themselves go to SQLite exactly
   as the Worker wrote them. */
